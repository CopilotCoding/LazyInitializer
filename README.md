# LazyInitializer
This is an attempt to create a generic implementation of lazy initialization.

# The ultimate goal of this project:

To create things such as:

    var varName;
    var varName = new();
    varName;
    varName = new();
  
 I really want to be able to code using symbolics alone without introducing the hassle of assigning numbers and initializing into the mess.
